# Crop Farming Strategies

## Min Max Table
Time Period | Activity | Crops to Plant | Production Tips
-- | -- | -- | --
Active Time (You can hop on every time) | Focus on quick XP and production. You’ll be able to harvest frequently. | Wheat (2 minutes), Corn (5 minutes), Carrots (2 hours) | Keep production buildings (Dairy, Bakery, Sugar Mill) busy. Process wheat into bread, corn into popcorn, and carrots into juice.
Work (Tentative hops on) | Need crops that can grow while you’re busy but still yield decent returns. | Soybeans (10 minutes), Tomatoes (20 minutes), Cotton (2 hours) | Use machines like the bakery and dairy for goods that can be produced while you're away. Keep an eye on orders that require soybeans or cotton.
Sleep (Longer period without being able to check in) | Plant crops that take a long time to grow so you don't waste time while sleeping. | Sugar Cane (5 hours), Cotton (2 hours), Pumpkins (5 hours) | Make sure production buildings are processing goods that take longer to make. Plan ahead for when you wake up.

### Min-Maxing XP Guide

#### 1. **Maximizing XP per Hour:**
   - **Short Growing Crops:** Prioritize crops with the shortest growing times, such as wheat and corn. These can be harvested multiple times per day, offering a good XP return.
     - **Wheat** (2 minutes to grow): A fast-growing crop for quick XP and essential for many production machines.
     - **Corn** (5 minutes to grow): A great option for quick XP, also highly demanded for various production processes.

#### 2. **Crops for Efficient XP and Profit:**
   - **Soybeans** (10 minutes to grow): Yield decent XP and are used in multiple production recipes like soy milk and tofu.
   - **Carrots** (2 hours to grow): Provide both good XP and a solid market price.
   - **Tomatoes** (20 minutes to grow): Another quick grower with a solid XP return, useful for various production recipes.

#### 3. **Longer Sessions - High-Yield Crops:**
   When you plan to be away from the game for extended periods, consider planting crops that balance XP and coin yield, even if they take longer to grow:
   - **Sugar Cane** (5 hours to grow): A high-yield crop that produces a lot of sugar for the bakery and offers good XP.
   - **Cotton** (2 hours to grow): Necessary for fabric production, which is required for other recipes, and provides decent XP.

#### 4. **Optimizing Production Buildings:**
   - **Dairy, Bakery, Sugar Mill:** Use harvested crops in production buildings to convert them into goods that reward both coins and XP.
     - For example, turn wheat into bread, corn into popcorn, and soybeans into soy milk. These products contribute both to farm expansion and XP gains.

#### 5. **Cycle Planting for Efficiency:**
   - **Set a Planting Schedule:** Plant quick-growing crops during active hours (wheat, corn, and carrots), and longer-growing crops (like sugar cane, cotton, and pumpkins) during inactive hours.
   - **Maximize Farm Expansion:** Use expanded farm space wisely to grow as many crops as possible throughout the day.

#### 6. **Crop Specialization for Better ROI:**
   - Focus on crops that provide the best ROI for XP per hour once you've unlocked them. For instance, wheat is ideal for quick XP, but crops like tomatoes and soybeans may offer better returns for long-term growth.
