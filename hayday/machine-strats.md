This table summarizes the strategies for different times, helping you optimize your XP and output in Hay Day!

## Strategies detailed

### **Weekend or After Work Strategies** (When you have more time to manage your farm)

- **Focus on Long-Building Items:**  
   Use your machines to craft long-production items like cakes, pies, or other high XP items. This is great for weekends or after work because these items take longer to make, and you can check back to collect them when you have time. The longer production times yield more XP.

- **Maximize Machine Output:**  
   While you're active, try to keep all machines (bakery, sugar mill, dairy, etc.) running to keep your production consistent. If you’re near your machines often, check if they’re done and queue up new tasks. Make sure all machines are always occupied.

- **Use the Factory or Production Buildings:**  
   If you’ve unlocked the factory or other high-level buildings, focus on making items that take a long time to craft but provide high XP, such as the **Pie Oven** or **Cottage** items.

- **Event Participation:**  
   During the weekend or when you have time, try participating in **events** (if available). These can reward you with double or extra XP for certain tasks, so focus on completing those events for maximum benefit.

### **During Work** (When you’re away from the game for extended periods)

- **Set Up Long-Timed Tasks:**  
   Before you leave for work, set up long-timed tasks in your machines. Focus on items like **Cakes**, **Muffins**, or **Butter**, which can take anywhere from 2-8 hours to produce. Set them up and then let them run throughout your workday.

- **Invest in Automated Machines:**  
   If you have higher-tier machines, use them to produce more complex goods. These will often take longer but provide more rewards. For example, the **Jam Maker** or **Honey Maker** requires more effort initially, but once set up, they produce high-reward goods without needing attention.

- **Maximize Storage and Production:**  
   Before work, check your storage and ensure you’re making the most out of it. You might want to leave crops or animals that take longer to produce out in the field or set them up to automatically produce products that can stay in your inventory until you get back.

### **While Sleeping** (Maximizing machines when you’re away for hours)

- **Set Up Overnight Production:**  
   The best way to maximize output while you’re sleeping is by setting up the **longest possible production time**. You can set machines to make **Cakes**, **Pie**, **Brownies**, or any other long-term recipe that can take up to 8+ hours. These items don’t require any active involvement, and you can collect them the next morning.

- **Max Out Animal Products:**  
   Make sure all animal pens are filled with animals so that when you sleep, they can produce milk, eggs, wool, and other products that will fill your inventory.

- **Prepare for Morning Harvest:**  
   Set up your **fields** with crops that will be ready to harvest in 8+ hours (like **Corn** or **Soybeans**). These can be harvested right when you wake up, providing a good amount of XP and goods.

- **Fill Orders:**  
   Set up your machines to craft goods for **truck orders** or **boat orders** that you can’t complete in the short term but can fulfill when you wake up. Fill them with items that have long timers to complete overnight.
