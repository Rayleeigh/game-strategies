| **Truck Orders**    | - Prioritize quick, high XP orders (e.g., wheat, corn, eggs).                                                  | - Complete when you have the necessary resources; avoid producing unnecessary items.                         |
|                     | - Focus on orders requiring items you have in stock to save time.                                               | - Balance full orders and partial fulfilling to save resources for other orders.                             |
|                     | - Stack orders with overlapping items to complete multiple at once.                                             | - Only complete an order if it’s efficient to do so based on your available resources.                       |

|                     | - Take advantage of "Double XP" or boat-related events.                                                           | - Don't hesitate to let boat orders sit until you're ready to complete them.                                  |
| **Town Orders**     | - Prioritize simple orders that require fewer resources (e.g., sandwiches, burgers).                           | - Regularly check for new orders to keep getting XP from town visitors.                                      |
|                     | - Focus on completing orders that provide high XP with minimal ingredients.                                    | - Don’t over-produce items unless you're specifically working on town orders.                                 |
| **General XP Min-Maxing** | - Balance between fulfilling orders and optimizing crop/production cycles.                                   | - Manage your silo and barn so that you don’t end up with excess goods you can’t use.                        |

## Order strats detailed

When aiming to **min-max** your XP gain through **orders** in **Hay Day**, it’s important to consider several factors for each type of order (truck, boat, and town) to ensure you're optimizing both your time and resources. Here's a detailed breakdown:

### 1. **Truck Orders**:
Truck orders are a steady source of XP and coins. To maximize XP:

- **Prioritize Quick, High XP Orders**: Always complete orders that give you the most XP for the least amount of time or resources. For instance, wheat, corn, or eggs usually take a short time to produce and give a decent amount of XP.
  
- **Complete the Order When It Makes Sense**: Sometimes, truck orders will require items you don't have in abundance. It’s often more efficient to focus on orders that require items you already have stockpiled in your silos rather than starting new productions.

- **Balance Between Full Orders and Partial Fulfilling**: While it can be tempting to complete an order fully, sometimes it's better to leave an order halfway fulfilled to ensure you’re using resources more efficiently for other orders. If you don't have the resources now, don't be afraid to wait for them or fill part of the order for lesser XP.

- **Stack Orders**: If you have several truck orders with overlapping items, it’s best to stack them so you can complete multiple orders at once when items finish processing.

### 2. **Boat Orders**:
Boat orders give a nice XP boost but are often more demanding.

- **Filling Boat Orders Efficiently**: If you can, try to prioritize boat orders that provide high XP per item. For example, filling boat orders that require higher-level crops or products (e.g., pies, cakes, or fishing items) can give more XP per unit, even if they take more time to produce.

- **Use the "Double XP" Strategy**: If there's a boat event or a "double XP" event, it’s an ideal time to focus heavily on boat orders. You can speed up your XP gain by taking advantage of these special periods.

- **Don’t Focus on Orders You Can't Complete Quickly**: If you’re not producing a lot of fish or crops that are required for boat orders, you may want to skip those until you have the necessary stock. Otherwise, you risk using too many resources on one boat that doesn’t provide much XP in return.

### 3. **Town Orders**:
Town orders are a bit different as they require interaction with the town’s visitors.

- **Maximize Town XP with Minimal Resources**: Some town orders are easier to complete than others. For example, giving a visitor a sandwich, burger, or simple dish can be easier than more complex recipes like pies or cakes. Always weigh the effort of producing these items versus the XP you’ll get.

- **Revisit the Town for New Orders**: Once you've completed an order and sent visitors away, new orders will come in. To keep getting XP from town orders, make sure you’re constantly interacting with the visitors. If you have extra time, work on maintaining the buildings at max capacity.

- **Don’t Over-Produce for Town**: Town orders sometimes require ingredients or products that aren’t easily available in large quantities. Don’t waste too much production time here unless you're in the middle of a high-reward event.

### 4. **Considerations for Min-Maxing XP**:

- **Time Management**: The time it takes to produce items in production buildings and the time between harvests is a major factor. Balance completing orders with maximizing your crop and production cycle. For example, while waiting for wheat to grow, you could focus on boat orders that need wheat-related items.

- **Silo Management**: Always keep an eye on your silo and barn. To min-max, avoid letting your silo or barn become full. Regularly offload your goods through trade or selling to friends to prevent getting stuck with unusable resources.

- **Efficient Use of Diamonds**: Occasionally, you'll be tempted to use diamonds to speed up production or purchase expansion items. Be strategic with these, as diamonds are a limited resource, and using them effectively can give you a boost in completing orders faster or re-stocking when you’re short on certain goods.

- **Events**: Always check event calendars. Some events give extra XP for fulfilling specific types of orders (e.g., boat orders or truck orders), so plan accordingly during those times.
